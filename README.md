Some odds-and-ends code examples created for courses I've taught or for self-study

This repo has Jupyter notebooks containing the following:
- An illustration of matrix techniques in computer graphics used in a matrix methods course. Includes a video of Swoop the Eagle doing a backflip! (The three videos created in this notebook are also saved separately as mp4 files.)
- An illustration of using calculus I optimization techniques to find line of best fit.
- My attempt at the popular Kaggle Titanic competition.
- A implementation of an exercise from **The Elements of Statistical Learning** involving computing a Bayes optimal decision boundary for data generated from mixtures of multinomial normal distributions.
- My solution to a toxic post-flagging problem, using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data.
- Python implementations of mergesort, heapsort, and quicksort.
