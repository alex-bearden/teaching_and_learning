Some odds-and-ends code examples created for courses I've taught or for self-study

This repo has Jupyter notebooks containing the following:
- [An illustration of matrix techniques in computer graphics used in a matrix methods course.](https://github.com/alex-bearden/teaching_and_learning/blob/main/mm_computer_graphics.ipynb) Includes [a video of Swoop the Eagle doing a backflip](https://github.com/alex-bearden/teaching_and_learning/blob/main/swoop_backflip.mp4)! (The three videos created in this notebook are also saved separately as mp4 files.)
- [An illustration of using calculus I optimization techniques to find line of best fit.](https://github.com/alex-bearden/teaching_and_learning/blob/main/line_of_best_fit.ipynb)
- [My attempt at the popular Kaggle Titanic competition.](https://github.com/alex-bearden/teaching_and_learning/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb)
- [An implementation of an exercise from **The Elements of Statistical Learning** involving computing a Bayes optimal decision boundary for data generated from mixtures of multinomial normal distributions.](https://github.com/alex-bearden/teaching_and_learning/blob/main/ESL_Ch2_Exercises.ipynb)
- [My solution to a toxic post classification problem](https://github.com/alex-bearden/teaching_and_learning/blob/main/post_flagging_bow.ipynb), using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data.
- [Python implementations of mergesort, heapsort, and quicksort.](https://github.com/alex-bearden/teaching_and_learning/blob/main/sorting_algs.py)
